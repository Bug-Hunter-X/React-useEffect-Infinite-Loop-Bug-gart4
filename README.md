This repository demonstrates a common React bug: an infinite loop caused by an improperly used `useEffect` hook. The `bug.js` file contains the buggy code, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version.  The issue arises from the missing dependency array in `useEffect`, causing it to re-run on every render, creating a loop.
